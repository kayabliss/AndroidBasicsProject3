## About The Project

There are many Android Task list application.  For this particular application, I wanted to create a very simple task list that the user can write, edit or delete effortlessly.

Here's why:
* People are busy and simple want something that is effective and will be easy to use. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* As part of the class assignment I was able to use explicit intents to get the data to be sent from one activity to another and then returned back.
* This project is able to help other while I also pratice my android kotlin skills.
